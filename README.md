# Project Tic-Tac-Toe - Javascript 

This is the famous tic-tac-toe game written in Javascript. We implemented some extra features to it.This is a game for 2 players. While starting the game you will be asked to enter your names. After that, you will see a big square divided in 9 equally sized smaller spaces. In each turn, the player chooses an empty space. Each player icon is unique and it is represented either by X or O. The main goal of this game is to mark a straight single line in sequence. This will make you a winner. You are not allowed to take other's player position. You should only capture free spaces. If, in the end, none of the players achieve a straight single line the result is Draw and you have to re-run a new one.
